==================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/sos4nt/jack-of-all-tweets.png)](http://travis-ci.org/sos4nt/jack-of-all-tweets)

This is a small web app for exploring Twitter's [REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api).

* authorization via [Sign in with Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/sign-twitter)
* paginated listing of users you are following
* paginated listing of users matching a search
* follow / unfollow multiple users by selection
* monitor rate limit and feature rate limit status
* lightweight - the web app doesn't have a database, OAuth token and token secret are stored in a cookie
